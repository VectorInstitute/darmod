The Data Readiness, Model Development, and Model Deployment (DaRMoD) training program takes place over the course of 4 months. It is designed to equip startups new to AI with the essential knowledge and skills required to accelerate the implementation of a machine learning application within their organizations.

Through three focused modules - Data Readiness, Model Development, and Model Deployment - participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the AI development process. Starting with data collection and preprocessing, participants will progress to selecting appropriate algorithms, training models, and evaluating their performance. Participants will then learn about strategies for deploying these models in real-world scenarios.

The program culminates in a showcase day, allowing participants to demonstrate the progress they've made. Led by industry experts, the program offers a structured learning environment with hands-on exercises and practical examples. By the end of the program, participants will have the confidence to leverage AI technologies effectively within their ventures.

## Learning Objectives

- Refine and articulate their machine learning use case into a well-defined and actionable problem statement with clear objectives, target metrics, and stakeholder considerations
- Apply responsible AI design thinking to their use case from product ideation to product post-deployment
- Assess the readiness of their datasets for machine learning applications, applying data collection and data preparation techniques to improve the robustness of their models
- Explore appropriate machine learning algorithms and techniques based on the nature of their problem, data availability, and computational resources
- Evaluate their models using relevant metrics and iterate to achieve the desired performance
- Develop a deployment strategy, considering factors like latency, resource utilization, and scalability

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Each team should have at least one technical member whoâ€™s comfortable working in Python notebook environments (e.g. Jupyter, Google Colab).

## Delivery

This workshop will be delivered in an interactive lecture/discussion format, with practical examples and case studies used to spark reflection and questions. All lessons will be delivered online as per the dates and times noted above.

## Total Commitment Time

The program is designed to be completed in 5-7 hours per week. The time will depend on prior knowledge and how quickly each learner is able to absorb and assimilate the information.

## Completion Certificates

Participants who actively participate throughout the duration of the program and successfully showcase their work during the Showcase Day will receive a certificate. Your certificate will be automatically generated and emailed once these conditions are met.
