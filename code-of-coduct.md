For online programs, the virtual meeting platforms (Zoom and Slack) are considered the classroom and the same protections, expectations, guidelines, and regulations used in face-to-face settings apply, plus other policies and considerations that come into play that are specific to the online program environment.

Inappropriate online behaviour will not be tolerated. Examples of inappropriate online behaviour include, but are not limited to:

- Posting inflammatory messages about your instructor or fellow students
- Using obscene or offensive language online
- Copying or presenting someone else's work as your own
- Adapting information from the Internet without using proper citations or references
- Buying or selling term papers or assignments
- Posting or selling program materials to course notes websites
- Having someone else complete your assignment or completing an assignment for another student
- Stating false claims about lost quiz answers or assignment submissions
- Threatening or harassing a student or instructor online
- Discriminating against fellow students, instructors, and/or TAs
- Using the program website to promote profit-driven products or services
- Attempting to compromise the security or functionality of the meeting platforms
- Sharing your username and password

If you exhibit inappropriate behaviour you will be issued a warning. If the behaviour continues you may be asked to leave the program.
